I never worked with web components before, so I hope this project covers some best practices of web components.
The reason I am using web components is because Dott is using it for the real project and I want to know if it's possible for me
to learn the basic usage within one week.
So, any feedback will be very much appreciated.

What's not been done in this project:
- infinite scroll
